Braga, Portugal, 18 of November of 2022 (to remember about the 1st day)

This is my first project using Xararin.
I'm trying to apply the contents reading Microsoft Learn: 
https://learn.microsoft.com/pt-br/training/modules/create-a-mobile-app-with-xamarin-forms/1-introduction

In this project I use the Android Manager of Devices to emule an Android environment.
In iOS I can't test this, because I don't have an iPhone (Hello, Apple, think in the students what don't have Apple's devices :p )

Ah, before I forget: Microsoft please review your courses.
Some screenshots or text is different about what I see in Visual Studio, it's a mess to understand :/


See you in new updates here \o/
